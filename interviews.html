                    We conducted interviews with staff from various student services across campus to gauge their experiences assisting students facing academic struggles. The objective was to better understand the barriers to academic success students face at Michigan Tech, as well as learn the recourses available to address these challenges. We interviewed academic advisors, Student Disability Services, and the Student Success Center, as they work closely with students to promote academic achievement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    They each offered valuable insight into student struggles and the tailored recommendations offered based their on individual circumstances. We were informed of different campus resources designed to support students over obstacles that negatively impact their academic performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The interview questions were designed to gather comprehensive insight into how these resources are utilized, the nature of student struggles they’re presented, strategies used to better understand their students, and potential solutions that could help them through their situation. We also asked about their caseloads and response time to inquire how well students utilize the resources offered. Lastly, to better understand potential obstacles to academic success, we asked about the types of questions students ask and the struggles they report to staff. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    These interview questions led us to conclusions about different Michigan Tech student struggles, as well as recourses available to address them. We found that academic difficulties often stem from a combination of heightened academic anxiety and hesitancy to ask for help. While student services staff attempt to redirect students toward campus resources they noted that students oftentimes do not utilize the resources offered and in return struggle with their academic confidence. They proposed that students who face challenges shouldn’t navigate them alone, but take advantage of services provided by the university.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    These responses are very useful to determine how to better help the students. However, one of the problems is that students, especially first-generation, are not aware of what resources are offered by the university. First-generation students who came from less well funded schools may not have the tacit knowlegdge that there are programs to help them. Therefore, advertising these programs and making them more widely known would go a long way to helping students.

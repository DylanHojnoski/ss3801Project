                Problem Statement
            </h2>
            <p>
            Our project looked into the social inequalities of class registration, while focusing on socioeconomic backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
            Class scheduling places a burden on students who grew up disadvantaged due to lack of opportunities, and due to the nature of higher credits getting priority, puts these already disadvantaged students farther behind potentially preventing them from graduating on time. Academic Advisors are present to help alleviate this issue, but the problem still remains and its effects are still seen in cases where students are forced to stay another semester.

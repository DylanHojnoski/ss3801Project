                Website Overview
            </h2>
            <p>
            This website represents the compressive findings and resources for a class project focused on how science and technology intersects with social issues like inequality and power, and how science and technology interact with both structural and cultural inequities. The website offers a range of data and insights that highlight the challenges faced by students at Michigan Technological University (MTU), focusing on the disparities in the student experience with registrations and class scheduling.

                Project Purpose
            </h2>
            <p>
            With concerns about technology and its impact on campusâ€™ equity, inclusivity, and sense of belonging, the project hopes to bring awareness to MTU students and administrators the opportunities before university and its consequences. The project examined the experiences of students from different socioeconomic and educational backgrounds; through student survey responses and interviews with academic advisors and faculty members, the project explores how these disparities impact class registration, timely graduation, and college retention rates.

                Problem Statement
            </h2>
            <p>
            Our project looked into the social inequalities of class registration, while focusing on socioeconomic backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
            Class scheduling places a burden on students who grew up disadvantaged due to lack of opportunities, and nature of higher credits getting priority. These put already disadvantaged students farther behind potentially preventing them from graduating on time. This leads to intergenerational inequality as students who can't graduate on time have to spend more money to get their degree. While, academic advisors are present to help alleviate this issue, the problem still remains and its effects are still seen in cases where students have to delay getting their degree due to misunderstandings or financial issues.

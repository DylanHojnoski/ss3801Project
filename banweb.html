                    To modernize the website's resource page and enhance accessibility, several improvements were implemented. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The layout was updated to include tabs, icons, and collapsible sections for better organization. Accessibility was prioritized with larger fonts, increased spacing, and clear labels to improve readability. 
                    </p>
                    </div>

                <p>
                A "Quick Links" section highlights frequently accessed resources and allows students to favorite sections for easy navigation. 
                </p>

                <p>
                The search function was enhanced with resource suggestions as users type, and a navigation bar was added for instant access to main sections. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Mock-ups introduced designs such as a tabbed interface with dynamic panels, a card-based layout with clickable icons and descriptions, and a resource-centric design linking student needs to relevant tools. 
                </p>

                <p>
                A dashboard design was proposed, featuring a user profile summary, quick access panels for bills and grades, and a dynamic announcement banner. Categories were reorganized into Academics, Financial Services, Support Services, and Profile Management for clarity and efficiency. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Of course this is only a static image of what the resource page could look like, but using these thought processes and ideas, one could make the BanWeb page more readable, accessible, and generally more graphically appealing.
